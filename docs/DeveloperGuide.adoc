== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture remained largely the same, differing only in the way Model
is implemented. Instead of list of persons, the model now transmit data created by
multiple classes into the storage, instead of just one.

Such classes include Entry and others.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.UI Diagram
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Guilt Trip data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage`

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* This includes instances of Entry subclasses(Expense, Income, Wish, AutoExpenditure, Budget, TrackerReminder, etc.)
* DateReminder data are stored in Entry data.

[[Design-Statistics]]
=== Statistics component

.Structure of the Statistics Component
image::StatisticsClass.png[]

.  `Statistics` contains an ObservableMap of `MonthlyList` class.
.  `MonthlyList` contains an ObservableMap of `DailyList` class.
.  `DailyList` contains an ObservableMap of `CategoryList` class.
.  These lists are populated when the guiltTrip() is started up and the content is retrieved from Storage.
.  Any added entries are updated in the `CategoryList` and `DailyList` classes.

== Implementation
This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Data Presentation: Sort Command

==== Implementation

The sort command extends the Command class. It works on the SortedList by adding a Comparator to the List. By default, the EntryList is sorted by date.

. The user executes the command `sort typ/Expense s/ascending`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `SortCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `SortCommand` calls the `Model` 's sortFilteredEntryList to sort the list of entries.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("sort typ/Expense s/ascending")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

=== ViewHistory Command

==== Implementation

The viewHistory command extends the Command class. It calls methods from the Statistics Manager which handles the calculation of the statistics and returns it to the user.

. The user executes the command `viewHistory typ/Expense`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `viewHistoryCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `viewHistoryCommand` calls the `Model` 's generateHistory method which calls on the `StatisticsManager` generateHistory method to calculate the statistics for that type.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("viewHistory typ/Expense")` API call.

=== Toggle Panel Command

==== Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle panel command works:

image::ToggleSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ToggleActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Current method:* Toggle the panels from within MainWindow class.

Pros: Easy to implement.

Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.
