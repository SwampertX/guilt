== Introduction

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but can’t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally! More importantly, guiltTrip() is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, guiltTrip() can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `guiltTrip().jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your guiltTrip.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : lists all expenses and income
* `addAutoExp f/monthly n/drinks a/11.99 c/Food` : adds a recurring expense that will generate every day.
* `add c/Food typ/Expense n/Mala a/5.50 d/2019 09 09 t/food t/indulgence` : adds the specified expense to your
list of expenses
* `toggle wishlist` : toggles the wishlist panel
* `exit` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addExpense [n/<description>]`, `<description>` is
a parameter which can be used as `n/mala at deck`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [tg/TAG]` can be used as `n/mala at deck tg/mala` or as `n/mala at deck`.
* If multiple Prefixes of the same type were specified, guiltTrip usually accepts only the latest prefix, for example `n/mala tg/drinks n/llama meat`
, guiltTrip will only accept llama meat as the description.
====

=== AutoSuggestion

The first thing you will notice once you start typing in the command box, is AutoSuggest.
This is an intelligent bot that helps you navigate through your finance journey with GuiltTrip()!

Simply key in anything you like to start!!

image::autosuggest_startup.png[]

For example, you are new and would like to get some help! But your __shaky__ hands made you
type `hlp` instead! Don't worry, we have a Edit-Distance-based algorithm that can predict your
command. Isn't that cool?

image::autosuggest_hlp.png[]

Ahh okay! Seems that we can just kick start right away! How about recording that mala we ate at The Deck
this afternoon!

image::autosuggest_addExpense.png[]

Now since `addExpense` is a valid command, your friendly AutoSuggester is showing you how to use this command!
Isn't this COOL?

=== Categories
Ever feel like your list of expenses are extremely messy? This is where categories come in handy! Every entry belongs to one category, which makes it easier for you to organize your data! Categories can be either grouped under Expense or Income.
GuiltTrip comes with a default set of Categories as listed below. All entries must have a category.

* Income: `Business,Salary,Gifts,Loans`
* Expense: `Food,Travel,Family,Bills,Entertainment,Transport,Shopping,HealthCare,Groceries,Rent`

Categories for Expense, Budget and Wish all belong under the Expense Category. Categories for Income belong under the Income Category.
An example would be when creating a new Budget, the category that the budget was created must belong to one of the existing categories in Expense.

==== Adding Category : `addCategory`
If the default set of categories does not cover your needs, you can add more by calling addCategory.

Adds a new Category for either Income or Expense. The category added must not currently exist in the application.
Category names are case-insensitive.

Format: `addCategory cat/<category type> n/<category name>`

* `<category type>`: The type of Category that the new addition is under.
* `<category name>`: The name of the new Category.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you want to add a new category *CodingServices* under Income, enter the command `addCategory cat/Income n/CodingServices`
+
image::addingCategory-1.png[]

. The new category will thus be added to guiltTrip. You can verify it using `listCategories`.
+
image::addingCategory-2.png[]

Other Examples:

* `addCategory cat/Expense n/Transport`
* `addCategory cat/Income n/Lottery`

===== Editing Category : `editCategory`
Edits a current category's description. The category to be edited must exist in the current list of Categories
whether it be in the Expense CategoryList or the Income CategoryList. The new name for the category must not be a
duplicate of existing categories.

Format: `editCategory cat/<category type> o/<old category name> n/<new category name>`

* `<category type>`: The type of Category that the edited Category is under.
* `<old category name>`: The original name of this Category.
* `<new category name>`: The new name of this Category.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to edit an existing Category *Business* to *Bursary* under Income, enter the command `editCategory cat/Income o/Business n/Bursary`.

[start = 1]
. Let's say you want to view the Statistics in table form for period *2018/01* to *2019/12*. You then type in the command `viewTable p/2018-01,2019-12`.

[NOTE]
Finding by `Description` will show all entries which have some parts of the description keyword in them. For example,
finding `mala food` will show entries with either mala or food or both in their Description.

[NOTE]
Finding by `Tag` will show all entries with all the tags in them. For example, finding by `tg/eat tg/entertainment` will show entries with only
both tags. The reason for this is that tags should be more specific that entry Description.

[start = 1]
. Let's say you want to find all the expenses with Category name food. You then type `findExpense cat/Food`
